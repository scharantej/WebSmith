Sure! Let's design a Flask application that will help users create a simple blog website using a CMS (Content Management System). 

## Application Design

### HTML Files

1. **Homepage:** The main page of the website displaying recent blog posts, a search bar, and navigation options.

2. **Login Page:** Allows users to sign in to the CMS.

3. **Dashboard:** The primary control panel for the CMS, allowing users to manage posts, pages, and website settings.

4. **New Post Page:** The interface for creating a new blog post, including title, content, and featured image.

5. **Edit Post Page:** Allows users to modify existing blog posts.

### Routes

1. **Home Route:** Displays the homepage with recent blog posts.

2. **Login Route:** Directs users to the login page.

3. **Dashboard Route:** Leads users to the CMS dashboard.

4. **New Post Route:** Opens the page for creating a new blog post.

5. **Edit Post Route:** Directs users to the page for modifying an existing blog post.

6. **Post Route:** Allows users to view a specific blog post.

7. **Submit Post Route:** Handles the submission of a new blog post, saving it to the database.

8. **Update Post Route:** Handles updating an existing blog post in the database.

9. **Delete Post Route:** Deletes a blog post from the database.

10. **Search Route:** Processes search queries and displays relevant blog posts.

These constitute the foundation of your Flask application. You can expand upon this design based on the specific requirements of your blog website. Let me know if you have any questions. ðŸ˜Š
